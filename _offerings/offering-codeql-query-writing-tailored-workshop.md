### Overview

One of the most compelling aspects of CodeQL is its extensibility. Rather than
being limited to a set of out of the box functions, new functionality can be
added by authoring new queries using a powerful and comprehensive programming
language called QL. Having the ability to author new CodeQL queries has a number
of advantages such as being able to find new security vulnerabilities and being
able to model new frameworks and codebases to provide higher-fidelity
query results.

An important aspect of being successful with CodeQL is an ability to design and
write new CodeQL queries that solve new problems not addressed by the out of the
box queries provided with CodeQL. In addition to our CodeQL
Query Writing Training, which offers a fixed set of courses the you can select
from, this offering provides you with a way to request and participate in
workshops tailored to the unique business and technical challenges of your
organization.

In this offering, you will discuss your goals with a CodeQL Analysis Engineer
who will in turn compose a workshop tailored to your goals and requirements. The
workshop will be delivered in the same 2 hour format as the CodeQL Query Writing
Trainings but designed to address the needs that are tailored do your
organization and technical challenges.  

### Target Audience

- Security Researchers
- Application Security Teams
- Software Engineering Technical Leads

### Key Features and Benefits

 * A guided interactive training with a CodeQL expert to gain a deeper understanding of CodeQL.
 * Focused on a query writing topic of your choice.
 * Learn reusable patterns for query development for similar problems.
 * Receive example CodeQL databases, queries and learning material for continuing your learning after the session.

### Syllabus

This engagement will consist of the following stages:

 1. A kick-off and discovery call to identify and refine the topic of the workshop. Please bring any supporting material with you (samples, references, relevant codebases etc.).
 2. Creation of the Workshop by the CodeQL Analysis Engineer.
 3. Delivery of the workshop in a single 2 hour block of time.

### Learning/Business Outcomes

* Enhanced understanding of CodeQL topics covered by the tailored training workshop.
* Participants will be able to apply the patterns and approaches covered in the session to similar problems.
 * One or more queries identifying the example vulnerabilities or patterns to help accelerate your own query development for similar patterns.
  
### Prerequisites

 * An identified CodeQL query writing topic. Workshops are typically structured around an example of a security vulnerability or code pattern you wish to find using CodeQL.
