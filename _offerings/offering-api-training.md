## Overview

APIs allow you to access content programmatically that you would normally access via a user interface. GitHub's extensive API allows you to extend the platform to accommodate most modern workflows and easily get the data you need.

Explore ways to leverage GitHub's REST v3 or GraphQL v4 APIs in this hands-on session covering API examples, webhook use cases and troubleshooting, authentication mechanisms, and best practices. Also, learn the differences and when you may want to use tokens, keys, and GitHub Apps.
