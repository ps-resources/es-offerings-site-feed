## Overview

GitHub’s Security Advisory Services pairs you up with an expert from GitHub’s team to identify your organization’s top priorities for improving your Secure Software Development Lifecycle with GitHub Advanced Security. We will first work together to describe your current state of SSDLC/AppSec and developer workflow,  and define short-/mid-/long- term goals that you would like to achieve.

With these priorities in mind you and your advisor will define the requirements and create blueprint or updated SSDLC implementation for your oraganization.  The blueprint will detail how GitHub Advanced Security fits into the picture.

Furthermore, your advisor will build out detailed implementation/adoption and service delivery plan to accomplish these priorities, check in weekly to track progress, and have asynchronous communication channels available to work together to accomplish your goals.

At the end of the engagement you will get a report on all activities during the engagement.
