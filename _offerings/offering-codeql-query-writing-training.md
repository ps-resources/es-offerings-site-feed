### Overview

One of the most compelling aspects of CodeQL is its extensibility. Rather than
being limited to a set of out of the box functions, new functionality can be
added by authoring new queries using a powerful and comprehensive programming
language called QL. Having the ability to author new CodeQL queries has a number
of advantages such as being able to find new security vulnerabilities and being
able to model new frameworks and codebases to provide higher-fidelity query
results.

To support effective use of CodeQL, this engagement offers a systematic approach
to learning CodeQL through the use of a structured set of 2 hour courses on
topics relevant to new and experienced CodeQL authors. It offers introductory,
intermediate, and advanced courses in the following areas:

- **QL Core** - Which teaches the QL language fundamentals
- **Language Dependent Features** - Which teaches the specific details of using
  CodeQL (and the standard library) for a given programming language.
- **CodeQL Tooling, Infrastructure, and Practice** - Which covers a variety of
  topics in using the non-query related aspects of CodeQL in deployment and
  command line scenarios.
- **CodeQL Explorations and Projects** - Which covers advanced topics in CodeQL
  as well as custom designed projects such as capture the flag exercises.

### Target Audience

- Security Researchers
- Application Security Teams
- Software Engineering Technical Leads

### Key Features and Benefits

- A guided interactive training with a CodeQL expert to gain a deeper understanding of CodeQL.
- Gain proficiency in the topics covered.
- Learn reusable patterns for query development for similar problems.
- Receive example CodeQL databases, queries and learning material for continuing your learning after the session.

### Syllabus

Each course will be delivered as a 2 hour interactive remote session. An engagement will typically consist of multiple courses delivered as part of a "learning path" tailored towards your goals.

### Learning/Business Outcomes

- Enhanced understanding of CodeQL topics covered by the selected training modules.
- Participants will be able to apply the patterns and approaches covered in the session to similar problems.
  
### Prerequisites

- A CodeQL Analysis Engineer has discussed your training goals and has ensured that the courses are available for the topics you want to learn about.
- A CodeQL Analysis Engineer has made a recommendation for a learning path.
