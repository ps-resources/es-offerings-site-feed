### Overview

In this interactive session, GitHub’s experts will guide participants through practical labs and exercises, enabling engineers to immediately apply GitHub Code Security features within their repositories.

Participants will gain hands-on experience on how to integrate code scanning seamlessly into developer workflows, address vulnerabilities quickly with Copilot Autofix, and manage security campaigns—ultimately enhancing both security and developer productivity.

Code Security offers optionality in how it’s configured, and the session will highlight those options, as well as GitHub’s recommendation based on previous rollouts and best practices.

This offering is targeted at security teams and security champions who have to configure the tool, rather than those who just have to respond to the alerts.
