## Overview

The GitHub Accelerator is a fixed-duration engagement designed to rapidly onboard a single team/application onto GitHub leveraging best practices tailored to your organization’s needs. The GitHub Accelerator pairs a senior GitHub Architect with your team to implement patterns and processes in a production environment which can be used as a reference for additional teams.

## Target Audience

- Customers on a trial
- New customers
- Existing customers
- Cross functional teams

## Key Features and Benefits

- Evaluate, define, and implement organization configuration, compliance and security requirements, and templates in your GitHub environment
- Evaluate and define best DevOps practices based on your company and team needs leveraging GitHub
- Implement said practices in your environment with your target team
- Guide through migrations, integrations and extensions necessary to optimize GitHub in your environment
- Capture and share learnings with the broader organization

## Delivery Methods

### Remote

Full time for two weeks Monday-Friday; times are negotiated with the target customer team. This is generally 6+ hours daily sharing screens in addition to after-hours time for administration, custom work and customer-specific research.

### Onsite

Full time for two weeks Monday-Friday; times are negotiated with the target customer team. This is generally 6+ hours daily face-to-face in addition to after-hours time for administration, custom work and customer-specific research.

## Syllabus

This engagement is almost entirely hands-on by your team in your environment with guidance from our architects.  All Accelerators start with DevOps envisioning and a current state review, build a prioritized backlog, and then collaboratively implement that backlog. At the conclusion, your team shares their achievements and discusses their learnings with a broader audience. The GitHub Architect shares their assessment and provides recommendations for ongoing adoption and improvements.

## Learning Outcomes/Business Outcomes

After this engagement, you will have a reference team with production implementations of your top priority DevOps practices leveraging your environment and code. This team and the related assets can be referenced as you roll out other teams.

## Prerequisites

- Committed customer team for the duration of this engagement. This is frequently developers from a team supporting one of your applications/services, Center of Excellence representatives, build engineers and/or GitHub administrators.
- As needed customer participation for related roles (e.g., system/cloud/network administrators, security, etc.)
- Short but broad participation from key stakeholders
