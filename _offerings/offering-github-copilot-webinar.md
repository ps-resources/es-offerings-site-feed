### Overview

In this session, GitHub's experts will deliver a webinar presentation to an audience of 300-500 participants over a 2-hour timeframe for a large-scale adoption of GitHub Copilot features. 

The webinar’s content is based upon the existing GitHub Copilot fundamentals and GitHub Copilot intermediate training sessions. Each of these trainings have a "Webinar version" adapted for a large audience, focusing on a presentation format rather than hands-on exercises or live interaction, which are formats more suited for smaller groups.

Currently, there are two webinars to choose from. First, would be the GitHub Copilot fundamentals, which is where participants learn how to get started with GitHub Copilot, create effective prompts, optimize their experience with best practices, and  understand developer-focused governance. The second webinar option is GitHub Copilot intermediate, which is where participants dive deeper into GitHub Copilot practices, focusing on good coding techniques, best practices, advanced prompt engineering, and secure coding. By participating in a GitHub Copilot webinar, your organization accelerates development, improves code quality, and fosters innovation.

### Topics

Topics vary depending on the webinar. Below are the topics for each webinar:

- **GitHub Copilot fundamentals webinar topics:**  
  - GitHub Copilot overview  
  - Getting started  
  - Prompt engineering  
  - Tips and techniques  
  - Governance and control  
- **GitHub Copilot intermediate webinar topics:**  
  - Copilot introduction  
  - GitHub Copilot configuration  
  - Coding (e.g. unit tests, refactoring, and debugging)
