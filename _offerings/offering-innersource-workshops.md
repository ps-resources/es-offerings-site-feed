## Overview

Innersource is a cultural practice that enables open source-like sharing, collaboration, and reuse for proprietary software and documentation in the protected environment of your organization. Collaboration is an essential practice for organizations looking to break down silos and enable departments to work in partnership, rather than independently. Organizations that practice innersource can shift focus to optimizing for the company as a whole, not just for individual teams.

In this engagement, GitHub professionals will set baseline knowledge, facilitate discussion to establish alignment, and lead a practical workshop, resulting in the creation of a custom-tailored roadmap to implement innersource governance, administration, and culture.
